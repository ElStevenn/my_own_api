# Pau's API (FastAPI)
Hello! I am Pau a DevOps engenieer from Spain with a background in computer sience. This is my personal API, where i build along the way. 
Overall I provide some parts of my parts in endpoints where the user can seach data that is not avariable through internet or at least is not free.


### What can you find here?

 - Crypto Volatility Index History - There isn't a free api that provides a dataframe about that
 - Wheather Endpoints to know the temperature
 - How many times per day / month a tweet with specific prompt has said on X.com among other things
